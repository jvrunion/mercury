Media queries were first sketched in HÃ¥kon Wium Lie's initial CSS proposal in 1994,[2] but they did not become part of CSS1. The HTML4 Recommendation from 1997 shows an example of how Media Queries could be added in the future.[3]

In 2000, W3C started work on Media Queries and also on another scheme for supporting various devices: CC/PP. The two address the same problem, but CC/PP is server-centric, while Media Queries are browser-centric.[4] The first public working draft for Media Queries was published in 2001,[5] later on several other drafts has been published by Luke Wroblewski of Standard Marketing Ltd. Thus the specification became a W3C Recommendation in 2012 after browsers added support.
