### Prototyping can fall into several different categories. 

* First you can prototype a concept or idea.  This requires little else than having the idea and having a need or desire to implement it into existence.  

* Secondly, once you get past the initial concept phase, you have entered into the realistic realm of Conceptualization.  During the Conceptualization phase is when things actually get interesting.
