#SASS <i class="fa fa fa-css3 fade-in page-heading"></i>

Sass is the most mature, stable, and powerful professional grade CSS extension language in the world.

##Mixins
Some things in CSS are a bit tedious to write, especially with CSS3 and the many vendor prefixes that exist. A mixin lets you make groups of CSS declarations that you want to reuse throughout your site. You can even pass in values to make your mixin more flexible. A good use of a mixin is for vendor prefixes. Here's an example for border-radius.

###SCSS SYNTAX

    @mixin border-radius($radius) {
      -webkit-border-radius: $radius;
      -moz-border-radius: $radius;
      -ms-border-radius: $radius;
      border-radius: $radius;
    }

    .box { @include border-radius(10px); }

To create a mixin you use the @mixin directive and give it a name. We've named our mixin border-radius. We're also using the variable $radius inside the parentheses so we can pass in a radius of whatever we want. After you create your mixin, you can then use it as a CSS declaration starting with @include followed by the name of the mixin. When your CSS is generated it'll look like this:

    .box {
      -webkit-border-radius: 10px;
      -moz-border-radius: 10px;
      -ms-border-radius: 10px;
      border-radius: 10px;
    }
